## :rocket: Introduction

The application consists of two parts:

- _User authentication_. In this part you will find the login, sign up, confirm account, forget password and generate new password pages.

![LoginApp](./appImages/login.png)

- _Main application_. The aim of this project is to **manage your projects and tasks**.

You can **create** a new **project** using the following form:

![Create Project](./appImages/newProject.png)

And all of them will appear on the **homepage**.

![Main Page](./appImages/mainpage.png)

Within each project will appear the **related tasks** and the **collaborators** belonging to the project.

![Project](./appImages/project.png)

From the previous page you can **edit** and **delete** the **project** by clicking on _edit_,

![Edit Project](./appImages/editProject.png)

**create** new **task**,

![Create Task](./appImages/newTask.png)

Within each task, you can **edit** it, **delete** it or **indicate** whether it is **completed** and it will automatically appear by whom,

![Task](./appImages/task.png)

and you can also **add partners** to the project.

> **Note**
> All these functionalities can only be realised by the creator of the project!. Collaborators will only be able to look at the tasks
> contained in the project and indicate whether the task has been completed or not.

In addition, the application contains a **project search engine**:

## :wrench: Usage

To deploy the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone my repository with the command `git clone https://github.com/Inmacc96/UpTask_MERN.git`.
2. Access the backend folder from a terminal and run the following commands:

- `npm install`
- `npm start`

3. Next, access the frontend folder from another terminal and run the following commands:

- `npm install`
- `npm run dev`

Finally, you will have the server at http://localhost:4000 and the client at http://locahost:3000.

### :page_facing_up: Environment variables

It is important to add the _.env_ file in the backend folder with the following content:

```
MONGO_URI = XXXX

JWT_SECRET = XXXX

FRONTEND_URL = http://localhost:3000

EMAIL_USER = XXXX
EMAIL_PASS = XXXX
EMAIL_HOST = XXXX
EMAIL_PORT = XXXX
```

where

- `MONGO_URI` is the URI of your MongoDB database,
- `JWT_SECRET` is the key to generate and decrypt your JWT,
- the `EMAIL` variables are the credentials from where you send the mails.

In addition, you should add the _.env_ file in the frontend folder with the following:

```
VITE_BACKEND_URL = http://localhost:4000
```

If in doubt, please consult the administrator.
